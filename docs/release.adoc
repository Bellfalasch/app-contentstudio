== Introduction

Until the release of Enonic XP 7 the Content Studio app used to be a part of the XP distribution package.
*Content Studio 2.0* is the first version released on Enonic Market separately from XP.
It is compatible with XP 7.0 and will not work with earlier versions. This release includes some important features, as well as
a number of major improvements and bugfixes.

=== Context panel

In previous versions *Context panel* (previously "Detail panel") was available only in the Browse Content view. Starting from version 2.0,
the panel is available in the Content Edit view as well. User can now access widgets without having to switch to or open the Browse view.
The panel can be opened and closed by clicking the cog icon in the top right corner of the view.

Compared to the Context panel available in the Browse Content view, in this view the panel adds the widget for managing selected content, such
as adding new components to the page or configuring existing page components.

You can find more information about the Context Panel and widgets in the <<widgets#,dedicated section>>.
