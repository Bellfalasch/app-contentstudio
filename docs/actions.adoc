Depending on permissions, users may perform the following actions on selected content items

== New

The ``New`` action will launch the *New Content* dialog.

There are three ways to open the *New Content* dialogue in the Content Studio.

* The first method is with the shortcut - ``alt + n``.
* By clicking the ``New`` button in the toolbar
* By Clicking ``New``in the context menu, which is accessible by right-clicking an item

NOTE: The content dialogue will use the context of the selected content to create the new item. If no context is set, item will be created on root level

=== New by Type

The dialog lets you choose from available content types, based on the context of the selected item.

* Select from the list of all content types
* Select from the "Popular" list (Most used content types in your current context)
* Select from the "Recent" list (Based on users recent actions)

TIP: To filter the list of items - simply start typing on your keyboard to filter the list of available content types

Once a content type is selected, a new item is created, and the content editor is launched in a new tab.

=== New by Uploading

Create file-based content aka "media" from the new content dialog by uploading.
There are two ways to upload files:

* Click the upload icon placed in the top right of the dialog.
* Drag'n drop - also supports bulk uploading
